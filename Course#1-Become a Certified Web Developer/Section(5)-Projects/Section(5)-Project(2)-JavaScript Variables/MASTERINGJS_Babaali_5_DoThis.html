        ->Question: Why do you
        think the output appear the way it does? What does
        this tell you about double quotes in JavaScript? 

        ->Answer: Since Js considers every things as a string in double quotes,
        then that's why the output does not show any numbers. In the other words,
        "age" is a string but age (without double quote) is assigned with integer number 44, 
        so the output would be 44. I show you the difference between these two with
        examples down below:

        <Example #1>:
        var age=44;
        var out=age;
        document.getElementById('').innerHTML=out; =====> Output is integer number 44.

        <Example #2>:
        var age=44;
        var out="age";
        document.getElementById('').innerHTML=out; =====> Output is string age.

        var age = 44; //Positive Integer
        var status = -100; //Negative Integer
        var gpa = 3.55; //Float
        var out = "Age: " + "age";
        out += "<br/>Status: " + "status";
        out += "<br/>Gpa: " + "gpa";
        document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = out;
