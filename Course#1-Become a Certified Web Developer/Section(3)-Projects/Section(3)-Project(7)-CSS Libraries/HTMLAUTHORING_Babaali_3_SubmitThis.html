                <p>
                    Iranian or Persian cuisine has introduced some
                    marvelous dishes of all time. Besides rice, vegetables, 
                    and fruits, spices like saffron, mahleb, cardamom and green
                    herbs play an important role. These foods are majorly spicy 
                    and tasty, being rightly influenced by Turkish, Russian, 
                    and Central Asian cuisines.

                <p>
                    Afghan food or cuisine is mainly based on wheat, barley or rice,
                    but no matter what it is, it is enriched in rich spices and herbs,
                    mixed with some lemon zest for the tangy within the sweet and sour.
                    Like most of the Indian foods, Afghan cuisine sports richness in 
                    terms of their quality and once we get to know the recipes, it is
                    actually a household name that we hear on a regular basis.
