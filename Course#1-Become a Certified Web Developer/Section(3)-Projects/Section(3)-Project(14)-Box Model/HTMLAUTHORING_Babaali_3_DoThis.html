            <h3>Lion</h3>
            <p> 
                The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae 
                and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular,
                deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and 
                a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
                adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body
                length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184
                cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
                A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.
                Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
                The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically 
                does not.

            <h3>Giraffe</h3>
            <p> 
                The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered
                to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However,
                the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, 
                based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as 
                morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct,
                prehistoric species known from fossils.

                 The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck
                and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. 
                It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest
                extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in
                the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west
                to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.
                Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, 
                primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other
                herbivores cannot reach.
