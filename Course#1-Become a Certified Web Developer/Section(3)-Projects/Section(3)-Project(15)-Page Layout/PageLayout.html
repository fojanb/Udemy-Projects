    <h2>Vancouver</h2>
        <p> Vancouver (/vænˈkuːvər/ (About this soundlisten) van-KOO-vər)
            is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland
            region of British Columbia. As the most populous city in the province,
            the 2016 census recorded 631,486 people in the city, up from 603,502 
            in 2011. The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2,463,431 in 2016,
            making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. Vancouver has the
            highest population density in Canada, with over 5,400 people per square
            kilometre,[5][6] which makes it the fifth-most densely populated city with
            over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, Guadalajara,
            San Francisco,[7] and Mexico City. Vancouver is one of the most ethnically
            and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 52% of its residents are not
            native English speakers,[8][9] 48.9% are native speakers of neither English
            nor French, and 50.6% of residents belong to visible minority groups.[10]

            Vancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide 
            cities for livability and quality of life,[11][12][13] and the Economist
            Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city ranked among the top 
            ten of the world's most well-living cities[14] for ten consecutive years.[13]
            However, Vancouver also ranks as the most expensive city to live in Canada[15]
            and as the fourth-most expensive housing market globally.[16] In 2011, the city
            planned to become the greenest city in the world by 2020. Vancouverism is
            the city's urban planning design philosophy.
