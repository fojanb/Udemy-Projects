        <h1>Victoria BC - Canada</h1>
        <p> Victoria is the capital city of the Canadian province of 
            British Columbia, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island
            off Canada's Pacific coast. The city has a population of 
            85,792, and the Greater Victoria Area has a population of
            367,770. Victoria is the 7th-most densely populated city 
            in Canada with 4,405.8 inhabitants per square kilometre 
            (11,411/sq mi).
        </p>
    
        <p> Victoria is the southernmost major city in Western Canada and is about 100 km (60 mi)
            from British Columbia's largest city of Vancouver on the mainland. The city is about
            100 km (60 mi) from Seattle by airplane, ferry, or the Victoria Clipper passenger-only 
            ferry, and 40 km (25 mi) from Port Angeles, Washington, by ferry Coho across the Strait 
            of Juan de Fuca.
        </p> 
         
        <p>     
            Named for Queen Victoria, the city is one of the oldest in the Pacific
            Northwest, with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has
            retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular
            its two most famous landmarks, Parliament Buildings 
            (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia)
            and the Empress hotel (opened in 1908). The city's Chinatown is the second
            oldest in North America after San Francisco's. The region's Coast Salish
            First Nations peoples established communities in the area long before
            European settlement,
            which had large populations at the time of European exploration.
