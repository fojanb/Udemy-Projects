        <h2>Vancouver</h2>
            <p> Vancouver (/vænˈkuːvər/ (About this soundlisten) van-KOO-vər)
                is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland
                region of British Columbia. As the most populous city in the province,
                the 2016 census recorded 631,486 people in the city, up from 603,502 
                in 2011. The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2,463,431 in 2016,
                making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada.<br> Vancouver has the
                highest population density in Canada, with over 5,400 people per square
                kilometre,[5][6] which makes it the fifth-most densely populated city with
                over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, Guadalajara,
                San Francisco,[7] and Mexico City. Vancouver is one of the most ethnically
                and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 52% of its residents are not
                native English speakers,[8][9] 48.9% are native speakers of neither English
                nor French, and 50.6% of residents belong to visible minority groups.[10]
    
                Vancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide 
                cities for livability and quality of life,[11][12][13] and the Economist
                Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city ranked among the top 
                ten of the world's most well-living cities[14] for ten consecutive years.<br>[13]
                However, Vancouver also ranks as the most expensive city to live in Canada[15]
                and as the fourth-most expensive housing market globally.[16] In 2011, the city
                planned to become the greenest city in the world by 2020.<br> Vancouverism is
                the city's urban planning design philosophy.
