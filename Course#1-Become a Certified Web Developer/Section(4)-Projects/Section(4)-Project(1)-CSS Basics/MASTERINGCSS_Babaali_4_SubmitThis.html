                With the mildest climate in Canada, gardens bloom year-round in Victoria.
                The city is tied closely to both land and sea and the rugged natural beauty 
                of the Pacific coast encourages all-season adventures in the great outdoors.
                Easily explorable by foot and at your own pace, a visit to Victoria can be as 
                relaxing and rejuvenating as it is educational and exciting. Take advantage
                of the diverse historical, architectural and multicultural makeup that comes
                from being the oldest city in the Pacific Northwest.
                From Indigenous Peoples history to British colonial and Asian traditions,
                and the landmarks, culture, cuisine, festivals and vibrant atmosphere that
                come with them, Victoria, B.C. is one of the world's favourite destinations.
